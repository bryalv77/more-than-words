        <b class="bolder">F</b>  <b class="bolder">A#9</b> <b class="bolder">Gm7</b>  <b class="bolder">A#</b> <b class="bolder">C</b>

[Primera Parte]

<b>F</b>            <b class="bolder">A#9</b>
  Saying "I love you"
    <b>Gm7</b>             
Is not the words 
   <b>A#</b>      <b>C</b>         <b>F</b>
I want to hear from you
                 <b>A#9</b>        
It's not that I want you 
 <b>Gm7</b>
Not to say, but
<b>A#</b>     <b>C</b>      <b>Dm</b> 
If you only knew

[Segunda Parte]

    <b>Gm7</b>  <b>C</b> 
How easy it would be
     <b>F</b>      <b>C</b>       <b>Dm</b>
To show me how you feel
           <b>Gm7</b>
More than words
   <b>C</b>               
Is all you have 
    <b>F7</b>            <b>A#</b>
To do to make it real
          <b>A#m</b>              <b>F</b>
Then you wouldn't have to say
          <b>Dm</b>
That you love me
       <b>Gm7</b>    <b>C</b>      <b>F</b> 
'Cause I'd already know

[Terceira Parte]

                <b>C</b>
What would you do
       <b>Dm</b>        <b>Am</b>       <b>A#</b>
If my heart was torn in two?
                             <b>Gm7</b>
More than words to show you feel
           <b>C</b>              <b>F</b>
That your love for me is real
                <b>C</b> 
What would you say
      <b>Dm</b>         <b>Am</b>     <b>A#</b>
If I took those words away?
                               <b>Gm7</b>
Then you couldn't make things new
         <b>C</b>              <b>F</b>
Just by saying "I love you"

[Estribillo]

<b>A#9</b>             
   Da ri da la ri 
 <b>Gm7</b>            <b>A#</b>
Ra ri la la ri la
 <b>C</b>         <b>F</b>    
More than words
 <b>A#9</b>            <b>Gm7</b>  <b>C</b>
Da ri da la ri ra

[Primera Parte]

<b>F</b>                 <b>A#9</b>
  Now that I've tried to
 <b>Gm7</b>             <b>A#</b>       
Talk to you and make 
    <b>C</b>      <b>F</b>   
You understand
         <b>A#9</b>             
All you have to do 
     <b>Gm7</b>
Is close your eyes
      <b>A#</b>       <b>C</b>         <b>Dm</b>
And just reach out your hands

[Segunda Parte]

     <b>Gm7</b>       <b>C</b>
And touch me, hold me close
      <b>F</b>     <b>C</b>      <b>Dm</b>
Don't ever let me go
           <b>Gm7</b>
More than words
   <b>C</b>           <b>F7</b>             <b>A#</b>
Is all I ever needed you to show
          <b>A#m</b>              <b>F</b>
Then you wouldn't have to say
          <b>Dm</b>
That you love me
       <b>Gm7</b>    <b>C</b>      <b>F</b>
'Cause I'd already know

[Final]

                <b>C</b> 
What would you do
         <b>Dm</b>      <b>Am</b>       <b>A#</b>
If my heart was torn in two?
                             <b>Gm7</b>
More than words to show you feel
           <b>C</b>              <b>F</b>
That your love for me is real
                <b>C</b> 
What would you say
      <b>Dm</b>         <b>Am</b>     <b>A#</b>
If I took those words away?
                               <b>Gm7</b>
Then you couldn't make things new
         <b>C</b>              <b>F</b>
Just by saying "I love you"</pre>
